# hello-world
my start in GitHub
It all started with two bicycles. I cut the front forks off of the first bike and shoved them onto the front forks of the second bike. Cool now I had a bike that looked more like a chopper. Funny thing is choppers don't react well when jumping dirt pulls. Thank you dirt for breaking my fall. 
Moral of the story is watch what you fork!
